## IT experiences üë®‚Äçüíª

#intro
In September 2021, I embarked on my professional retraining journey by enrolling in the BTS SIO option SLAM. This one-year program provided me with foundational knowledge in the field of computer science, covering both system/network and development aspects. The internship I completed at CFR confirmed my decision to transition into a developer role.

Following the attainment of my BTS, I joined the engineering school at CESI to continue my education. Since the curriculum involved alternating between work and study, I spent the year working at the animation studio Ooolala as a full-stack developer. This experience not only enhanced my development skills but also provided valuable insights into managing IT projects within a corporate environment.

Having successfully completed my year as an Application Developer, I decided to pursue a master's degree, continuing with CESI and engaging in an apprenticeship with ST Microelectronics.

All these experiences allow me to grow and deepen my knowledge. I enjoy learning, exploring new technologies, and methodologies. I am curious, open to new challenges, and ready to apply my skills to your needs. If you are in search of a developer or advice for a project, feel free to contact me ‚Äì I would be delighted to help!

Looking forward to connecting with you soon!
