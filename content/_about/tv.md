## Audiovisual experiences ðŸ“º

#intro
I had a fulfilling career as an audiovisual technician in various television channels. TF1, Canal+, and beINSPORTS are just a few of the companies where I have had the opportunity to work, and they are the ones where I flourished the most.
Here are some of the tasks and responsibilities I undertook for them:

#after_1
After 11 years as an audiovisual technician, I have decided to change the direction of my professional career and embark on a transition into the field of IT, aiming to become a develper. All these years in the audiovisual industry have taught me to be reactive and to constantly adapt to every situation. I learn quickly and enjoy discovering and using new work tools.

These experiences have not only enriched my technical skills but have also allowed me to thrive in dynamic and high-pressure environments.

Since my entry into IT in 2021, I have been happy and motivated to leverage my skills in a new and challenging manner.
