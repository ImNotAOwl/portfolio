[I am a **software engineer** and **curious** about new technologies. I love discovering new ways to develop high-quality and efficient software. My preferred domains are **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **DevOps**. I try to bring this philosophy into the companies where I work, to try to make it understood and demonstrate its value. Being a developer is about embracing challenges, and that's what fascinates me about my job.]{style="font-size: 18px;"}
